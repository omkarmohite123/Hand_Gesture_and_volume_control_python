# Hand_Gesture_and_volume_control_python


**pip install numpy**

Repeat the same process for the other libraries.

**pip install opencv-python**

We will import this library as cv2. We will use it to capture an image using the webcam and convert it to RGB.

**pip install mediapipe**

It is an open-source library developed by Google. We use it for both face and gesture recognition. For this tutorial, we’ll use it for hand gesture recognition.

**pip install pycaw**

We’ll need this library to access the device’s speaker and its master volume.

**pip install python-math**

We’ll use this library to find the distance between point number 4 (the thumb) and point number 8 (the index finger) using hypotenuse.

**pip install gpib-ctypes, comtypes**

pycaw depends on these two libraries. Ctypes provides C language compatible data types. Comtypes bases on the ctypes FFI(Foreign Function Interface) library.
